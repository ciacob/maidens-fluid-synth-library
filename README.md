# maidens-fluid-synth-library
Library built around yhuiban/flash-midi-player, that helps MAIDENS generate its sound in AS3, eliminating the need to resort to an external fluidsynth binary. The library is self-contained and could be used by other host projects as well (it is not tied to MAIDENS in any way, actually).
